# codeTest2i

if you would like to run each bit on their own comment out either multiples(), multiple2() or multiple3() by using #

the first function will iterate in multiples of A until X is reached
the second function will iterate in multiples of A + 1 until 2X
and the third function will iterate in multiples of A + 2 until 3X
